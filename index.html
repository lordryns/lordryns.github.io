        <h1>David</h1>
        
        <p>I've been writing code for a little over two years 
          but i can't say i've done a lot. As to what kind of developer i am, 
          i'm not too sure myself, 
          i can build websites 
          but i don't like to regard myself as a web developer 
          and instead i prefer to lean towards systems development 
          even though i am still not as proficient in the field as the 
          average systems developer. 
          One of my long term goals is to build a mini Operating system 
          as a side project but sadly my proficiency is not to that level yet 
          and so for now i'm satisfied (or at least i try to be) with building 
          cli tools, desktop and mobile apps, games, developer tools 
          and any other thing i consider fun at the moment.</p>

        <p>I think it might be worthy of note that i am not a CS student but rather i
           do software development solely as a hobby of mine and most 
           of my <a href="/project/">projects</a> seem to reflect that.
            Money is also not my motivation and i code simply because i like to 
            (the thrill of building was my motivation to begin and will continue to be my motivation as i advance)</p>

        <p>A number of my <a href="/project/">projects</a> are available on 
          <a href="https://github.com/lordryns">Github</a> and if you wish to contact me, 
          you can do so on either  <a href="https://x.com/lordrnys">X</a> (which i am most active on),
