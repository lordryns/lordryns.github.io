    <h1>The Javascript problem</h1>
    <p>Perhaps an alternative title for this blog could be <i>The web problem</i> 
      as the issue revolves around the web and how it has developed over the years.
    </p>

    <p>It is becoming increasingly noticeable that the web is becoming slower and 
      bloated with each passing year and this can easily be attributed to the activity 
      and behaviour of web developers. There has been a major shift from traditional methods 
      of web development to a now "modern" style where developers are obsessed with 
      <i>reactive</i> programming. Don't get me wrong, my problem does not lie with this 
      particular method of web development as it does have its uses. The problem can be simplified 
      into one word <i>"over-engineering"</i>. Web developers love to over-engineer and create a false 
      complexity out of what is ordinarily supposed to be simple.
    </p>

    <p>Web development is largely considered to be the easiest "genre" of programming as it is considerably 
    easier than areas such as game development, systems programming or even native application development and so 
    the job market is naturally over crowded as people are more willing to jump into the niche as opposed to 
    its more technical counterparts. This realisation forces web developers to create their own complexity in an 
    attempt to balance out this equation. Instead of the traditional HTML, CSS, Javascript bundled with SQL, there are now 
    15+ new terms that the average web developer is required to know and perfect in order to land a job.</p>

    <p>Another side effect of this occurrence would be the fact that it has arguably made the 
      web heavier and slower. Sites used to consist of a maximum of three files in the past, now 
      a simple todo app contains over 50mb worth of npm packages and their implementation usually always contributes to janky and 
      slow web apps. It is as though modern web developers have no idea of the concept of memory management as they are 
      usually overly eager to plug in the new shiny package they found into their 200mb "Hello World" React app.
    </p>


    <p><b>TL;DR:</b> Web developers have over-engineered and over complicated the once beautiful web.</p>
