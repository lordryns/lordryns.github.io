    <h1>Playing with C</h1>
    <p class="meta">This one's going to be a little random</p>
    <p>C has recently found its way into my top 5 favourite languages despite it being regarded as "unsafe" and hence lots of people are against learning (or writing it). 
        Before now, I had been stuck on what path to take in terms of software development. On one hand, the 
        Rust purists exist along with the C++ enthusiasts but I never quite took a liking to either of them. If anything, the language that 
        intrigued me the most was Zig in comparison to the others but the syntax keeps changing and so I am unable to settle down with it (I'll give it 
        another try when it finally hits 1.0).
    </p>

    <p>C is like a breath of fresh air for me (Ironic i know considering the language), it has so many real world uses and is exciting to write too plus I found it to 
        be quite simple to learn. Recently I have been experimenting with Raylib.h and i found it to be easier than expected. for example, creating a window is as simple as this:
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-c">
#include "raylib.h"

int main() {
  const int screen_width = 800;
  const int screen_height = 500;

  InitWindow(screen_width, screen_height, "My Game");

  while (!WindowShouldClose()) {
    ClearBackground(WHITE);
    BeginDrawing();

    DrawText("Hello World", 300, 150, 30, BLACK);
    EndDrawing();
  }

  CloseWindow();
}

    </code></pre>

<p>Isn't that amazing? When I first decided to try it out, I had braced myself for a horrendous amount of verbose code but little did I know I was in for a pleasant surprise.
    I'm however not blind to the fact that C has its downsides and the task of managing memory still falls on me and all that but I just wanted to share how much I've come to 
    enjoy writing C and for this reason, no I will not be switching to Rust anytime soon.
</p>

<p>This was so random that I didn't even know where I was going with it...</p>
