    <p>Confy's main selling point is convenience by attempting to provide an alternative to the usual messy way of dealing with configs</p>

    <h3 id="setup">Installing Confy</h3>

    <p>Confy is still very early in development and so there is no executable yet. To test, clone the repo and build manually. To do this run</p>

     <pre><code class="language-shell">
go mod tidy && ./build.sh # build.sh is for Linux only (it's a bash script if that wasn't obvious), Windows users should use go build -o bin/confy.exe
    </code></pre>

    <h3 id="commands">Using Confy</h3>
    <p>Jump to <a href="#api-reference">Api reference</a> to see the complete reference</p>
    <p>The <code>set</code> command is probably the one you'll be using most of the time. It's simple in practice, it sets a  new module/config and backs up the previous one</p>
        <pre><code class="language-shell">
confy set waybar path/to/new/waybar
        </code></pre>

        <p> The <code>rollback</code> command is one you'll like if you've ever messed up your config by mistake and spent hours trying to return it to its working state.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-shell">
confy rollback waybar
        </code></pre>
