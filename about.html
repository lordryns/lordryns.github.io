    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>My name is David, I'm from Nigeria and i like to build stuff. 
        This is kind of the main reason i decided to learn to code in the first place, If you want to hear more about that,
         read my blog about <a href="blog/why-i-code.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Why i code</a></p>

    <p>I'm almost 19 (by November) and i'm in my final year in the university, contrary to my skill set, I'm actually a 
        student of History (and International diplomacy).
    </p>

    <p>Well that's about everything you need to know about me (or rather everything i can think of), 
        there's nothing fun about my life, just this (sad i know)</p>

    <p>Anyway here are the important links: <a href="/">Go to Main</a> <a href="/blog/why-i-code.html">Why i code</a></p>
